# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
# Render uses two DATABASE_URL environment variable to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
# Copy the internal DATABASE_URL provided by Render to the DATABASE_URL variable below.
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name

# If not using DATABASE_URL, you can specify individual parameters:
DB_HOST = 127.0.0.1
DB_PORT = 5432
DB_NAME = database_name
DB_USER = username
DB_PASSWORD = password

# Base URL for the application
BASE_URL = http://localhost:5000

# Gmail SMTP server settings, all prefixed with EMAIL_â€¦
EMAIL_HOST = smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = true

# Gmail account credentials for sending emails
EMAIL_USERNAME = your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD = your_email_app_password # Use an app password for security
# App password can be generated in your Google account settings under Security > App passwords.
# App password is not the same as your Gmail account password.
EMAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = "Your Business Name <your_email@gmail.com>"

# User Deployment Instructions:
# 1. Replace `username`, `password`, `hostname`, and `database_name` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.
# 2. Replace `your_email@gmail.com` and `your_email_app_password` with your actual Gmail credentials.
# 3. Ensure that the EMAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER reflects your business name and email address.
# 4. Save this file as `.env` in your project root directory.
